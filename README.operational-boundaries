# File: /opt/ansible-k3s-cluster/README.operational-boundaries
# =============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   Document the operational boundaries between:
#     - builder user
#     - ansible user
#     - cluster nodes
#   This ensures clear separation of duties, auditability, and reproducibility.
#
# Boundaries:
#
#   Builder User:
#     - Owns kernel source tree.
#     - Runs distributed kernel builds.
#     - Does NOT run Ansible.
#     - Does NOT modify cluster nodes directly.
#
#   Ansible User:
#     - Deploys kernels.
#     - Manages distccd on worker nodes.
#     - Performs cluster-wide automation.
#     - Does NOT compile kernels.
#
#   Cluster Nodes:
#     - Run distccd.
#     - Run k3s workloads.
#     - Receive kernel artifacts from ansible.
#
# Notes:
#   - These boundaries prevent privilege overlap.
#   - Ensures long-term maintainability and operational clarity.
