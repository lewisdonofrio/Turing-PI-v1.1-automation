# =============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   Provide the high-level operational theory behind the cluster automation
#   framework. This explains *why* the system is structured the way it is.
#
# Operational Principles:
#
#   1. Separation of Duties
#      - Builder builds
#      - Ansible deploys
#      - Nodes execute
#
#   2. Immutable Artifacts
#      - Builder produces canonical kernel artifacts
#      - Nodes never modify them
#
#   3. Observability First
#      - Every subsystem has a diagnostic playbook
#
#   4. Reproducibility
#      - All operations documented
#      - All files ASCII-safe and nano-safe
#
#   5. Safety and Rollback
#      - Every deployment must be reversible
#
# Notes:
#   - This file defines the philosophy behind the entire framework.
