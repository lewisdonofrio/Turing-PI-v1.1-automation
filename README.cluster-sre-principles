# Purpose:
#   Define the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles applied to the
#   cluster automation framework. This ensures long-term reliability and
#   operational excellence.
#
# SRE Principles:
#
#   1. Eliminate Toil
#      - Automate diagnostics
#      - Automate deploy/rollback
#
#   2. Observability Everywhere
#      - Every subsystem has a report
#      - Every report is ASCII-safe
#
#   3. Reduce Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
#      - Fast rollback
#      - Fast diagnostics
#
#   4. Enforce Reproducibility
#      - Deterministic builds
#      - Deterministic deployments
#
#   5. Design for Failure
#      - Assume SD card corruption
#      - Assume node outages
#
# Notes:
#   - This file defines the SRE philosophy behind the cluster.
