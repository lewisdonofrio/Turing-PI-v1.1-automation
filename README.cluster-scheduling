# Purpose:
#   Document scheduling considerations for distributed kernel builds and k3s
#   workloads. This ensures the cluster remains responsive during heavy builds.
#
# Scheduling Guidelines:
#
#   1. Build Scheduling
#      - Run distributed builds during low-load periods
#      - Avoid builds during k3s workload spikes
#
#   2. Node Load Management
#      - Monitor load with cluster-health.yml
#      - Adjust DISTCC_HOSTS if nodes are overloaded
#
#   3. k3s Scheduling
#      - Ensure CPU/memory reservations for system workloads
#      - Avoid starving distccd processes
#
#   4. Thermal Scheduling
#      - Avoid builds during high ambient temperatures
#      - Monitor with cluster-temp-report.yml
#
# Notes:
#   - Proper scheduling prevents cluster slowdowns and build failures.
