# Purpose:
#   Provide a troubleshooting reference for common issues encountered during
#   cluster automation, kernel deployment, and distributed builds.
#
# Common Issues:
#
#   1. SSH Failures
#      - Ensure ansible user has correct private key.
#      - Ensure known_hosts contains FQDN entries.
#
#   2. distcc Not Distributing Jobs
#      - Verify distccd is running on all nodes.
#      - Check DISTCC_HOSTS on builder.
#      - Run distcc-status.yml.
#
#   3. Kernel Deployment Fails
#      - Ensure kernel artifacts exist on builder.
#      - Run kernel-backup.yml before deployment.
#      - Verify /boot and /lib/modules permissions.
#
#   4. Node Fails to Boot After Kernel Update
#      - Use kernel-rollback.yml.
#      - Inspect /var/backups/kernel-<timestamp>.
#
#   5. k3s Not Starting
#      - Verify required kernel modules exist.
#      - Confirm overlayfs and br_netfilter are built-in.
#
# Notes:
#   - All troubleshooting steps assume operations are run as 'ansible'.
#   - All paths are absolute for reproducibility.
