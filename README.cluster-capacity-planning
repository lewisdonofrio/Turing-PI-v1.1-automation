# =============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   Document capacity planning guidelines for the cluster. This ensures the
#   cluster remains performant under both k3s workloads and distributed builds.
#
# Capacity Planning Guidelines:
#
#   1. CPU
#      - Ensure total cluster CPU > 4x builder CPU for optimal distcc scaling
#
#   2. Memory
#      - Maintain at least 20% free memory on each node
#
#   3. Storage
#      - SD cards degrade; replace every 12–18 months
#
#   4. Network
#      - Ensure <1ms latency between nodes
#      - Avoid Wi-Fi for distcc traffic
#
#   5. Thermal
#      - Keep nodes below 70°C under load
#
# Notes:
#   - Update this file as the cluster grows or workloads change.
