# =============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   Document the security boundaries, privilege separation, and operational
#   constraints of the k3s cluster automation and build system.
#
# Security Principles:
#   1. Separation of Duties
#      - 'ansible' performs automation.
#      - 'builder' performs kernel compilation.
#      - Neither user crosses into the other's domain.
#
#   2. Least Privilege
#      - 'ansible' has no sudo on cluster nodes.
#      - 'builder' has no SSH access to cluster nodes.
#
#   3. Explicit Boundaries
#      - Kernel tree lives under /home/builder.
#      - Automation repo lives under /opt/ansible-k3s-cluster.
#      - SSH keys are isolated per user.
#
#   4. Reproducibility
#      - All paths are absolute.
#      - All scripts are ASCII-safe.
#      - All playbooks are idempotent.
#
# User Roles:
#   ansible:
#     - Runs playbooks
#     - Deploys kernels
#     - Manages distccd on nodes
#
#   builder:
#     - Builds kernels
#     - Runs distcc client
#     - Maintains kernel source tree
#
# Notes:
#   - This model ensures auditability and long-term maintainability.
#   - No user has unilateral control over the entire system.
