# =============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   Define the operational boundaries between builder, ansible automation, and
#   cluster nodes. This ensures clean separation of duties and safe operations.
#
# Boundaries:
#
#   1. Builder
#      - Owns kernel source
#      - Owns build artifacts
#      - Owns build metadata
#
#   2. Ansible
#      - Owns deployment
#      - Owns diagnostics
#      - Owns rollback
#
#   3. Nodes
#      - Execute workloads
#      - Run distccd
#      - Report health
#
# Enforcement:
#   - No node modifies artifacts
#   - No ansible modifies source
#   - No builder modifies node state
#
# Notes:
#   - These boundaries prevent accidental cross-contamination of responsibilities.
